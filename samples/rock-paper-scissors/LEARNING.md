## 🧠 Key Technical Learnings

### TypeScript Best Practices
```typescript
// Learned: Use discriminated unions for type safety
type GameResult = 'player_victory' | 'computer_victory' | 'in_progress';

// Learned: Readonly arrays prevent accidental mutations
readonly rounds: ReadonlyArray<Round>;

// Learned: Type guards for runtime validation
function isValidChoice(choice: string): choice is Choice {
  return Object.values(Choice).includes(choice as Choice);
}
```

### Architecture Patterns
```typescript
// Learned: Interface segregation for flexibility
interface Player {
  getChoice(): Promise<Choice> | Choice;
}

// Learned: Immutable state management
return {
  rounds: [...this.rounds],
  score: { ...this.score },
  result: this.getGameResult(),
  isComplete: this.isGameComplete()
};
```

### Testing Strategies
```typescript
// Learned: Comprehensive test structure
describe('Component', () => {
  describe('Feature', () => {
    test('specific behavior', () => {
      // Arrange, Act, Assert pattern
    });
  });
});

// Learned: Statistical testing for randomness
test('distribution is reasonably fair over many choices', () => {
  const choices = computerPlayer.generateChoices(3000);
  // Verify statistical distribution
});
```
