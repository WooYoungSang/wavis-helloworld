- Continues interaction flow properly

---

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria Verification

### ✅ "Yes button shows 'Payment completed' alert"
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Evidence**: E2E and integration tests verify alert message
- **Implementation**: `alert('Payment completed')` in `handleYesButton()`

### ✅ "Alert dismissal closes modal and returns to normal state"
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Evidence**: Modal closes, focus returns to main button
- **Implementation**: `closePaymentModal()` after alert

### ✅ "No button closes modal without alert"
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Evidence**: No alert triggered in No button path
- **Implementation**: Direct `closePaymentModal()` call

### ✅ "State remains consistent after modal interactions"
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Evidence**: Click count preserved, state accessible via API
- **Implementation**: State management maintains integrity

### ✅ "Continued clicking works after modal closure"
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Evidence**: Button remains responsive, messages continue
- **Implementation**: No state corruption after modal actions
