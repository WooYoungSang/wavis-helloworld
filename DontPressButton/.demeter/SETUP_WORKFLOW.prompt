# üåæ Demeter v2.0 - Setup Workflow (Phase 0-2)

## Project Information
- **Name**: DontPressButton
- **Requirements File**: docs/requirement.md
- **Framework**: Demeter WAVIS v2.0 Constitutional SDD
- **Template Path**: /home/jang/Workspace/hello-world
- **Extensions**: AI will analyze requirements and auto-determine appropriate extensions

## üéØ Setup Phase Execution (Phase 0-2)

### Phase 0: Constitutional Project Initialization
1. **Create Constitutional Foundation**:
   - Generate PROJECT-constitution.yaml with 9 Constitutional Principles
   - Setup governance rules and enforcement mechanisms
   - Create constitutional compliance templates
   - Initialize AI development guidelines (CLAUDE.md)

2. **Project Structure Setup**:
   - Standard directories (docs, src, tests, config, deployments)
   - GraphRAG knowledge base (.demeter-dev/knowledge/)
   - Constitutional governance structure
   - Batch execution system directories

3. **AI-Driven Extension Analysis**:
   - Analyze requirements file to determine appropriate domain extensions
   - Auto-detect: e-commerce, fintech, healthcare, iot, gdpr, security, etc.
   - Apply domain-specific configurations based on analysis
   - Setup extension-specific constitutional requirements
   - Configure compliance frameworks as needed

### Phase 1: Requirements & SSOT Generation
1. **AI-Enhanced Requirements Analysis**:
     - Analyze provided requirements file: docs/requirement.md
   - Auto-determine domain extensions from requirements content
   - Apply constitutional principles to requirements
   - Generate constitutional compliance specifications
   - Set up domain-specific configurations based on AI analysis

2. **SSOT System Generation**:
   - Use wavis-template SSOT system: /home/jang/Workspace/hello-world/demeter/core/ssot/
   - Generate merged-ssot.yaml with constitutional integration
   - Create comprehensive SSOT documentation
   - Setup constitutional quality gates

3. **Constitutional Requirements Enhancement**:
   - Integrate 9 Constitutional Principles:
     * Library-First: Prioritize existing libraries over custom implementations
     * CLI Interface: Standardized command-line interface design
     * Test-First: Test-driven development methodology
     * Simplicity: Simple, readable, and maintainable code
     * Anti-Abstraction: Avoid unnecessary abstraction layers
     * Integration-First: Prioritize system integration capabilities
     * Minimal Structure: Minimal project structure and complexity
     * Framework Direct: Direct framework usage without wrappers
     * Comprehensive Testing: Complete test coverage requirements

### Phase 2: Planning & Architecture Design
1. **Execution Plan Generation**:
   - Create batch/execution-plan.yaml
   - UoW dependency analysis with constitutional constraints
   - Constitutional principle implementation roadmap
   - Quality gate and governance checkpoints
   - Resource allocation and timeline

2. **Constitutional Architecture Design**:
   - Library-first architecture specification
   - CLI interface design standards
   - Test-first development framework
   - Simplicity and anti-abstraction guidelines
   - Integration patterns and standards

3. **Development Framework Setup**:
   - Constitutional TDD cycle templates
   - Quality verification frameworks
   - Governance compliance monitoring
   - Knowledge capture and sharing systems

## üèõÔ∏è Constitutional Principles Integration

Ensure all setup phases integrate the 9 Constitutional Principles:

1. **Library-First Setup**: Configure dependency management prioritizing existing libraries
2. **CLI Interface Setup**: Establish standardized command structure and help systems
3. **Test-First Setup**: Configure testing frameworks and TDD infrastructure
4. **Simplicity Setup**: Minimize configuration complexity and setup overhead
5. **Anti-Abstraction Setup**: Direct configuration without unnecessary abstraction layers
6. **Integration-First Setup**: Configure for maximum integration capabilities
7. **Minimal Structure Setup**: Create only essential project structure
8. **Framework Direct Setup**: Direct framework usage without wrapper layers
9. **Comprehensive Testing Setup**: Complete test infrastructure configuration

## üéØ Setup Success Criteria

### Technical Setup Verification
- [ ] Project directory structure created with constitutional foundation
- [ ] Constitutional governance framework operational
- [ ] SSOT system generated and validated
- [ ] Execution plan created with dependencies mapped
- [ ] Development framework configured

### Constitutional Compliance Verification
- [ ] All 9 Constitutional Principles integrated into project foundation

## üöÄ Next Steps

After successful setup completion:
1. Review generated SSOT and execution plan
2. Validate constitutional compliance configuration
3. Proceed to Implementation Phase: `./demeter-implement.sh`
