## ðŸš€ Agent Collaboration Strategies

### 1. Parallel Agent Execution for Independent UoWs

**When UoWs can be implemented in parallel:**
```markdown
## Parallel UoW Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Agent Assignment
- **Agent 1**: UoW-002 (User Authentication)
- **Agent 2**: UoW-003 (Data Validation)
- **Agent 3**: UoW-004 (API Endpoints)

### Phase 2: Parallel Execution
Execute all agents simultaneously with:
- Independent research phases
- Parallel code implementation
- Concurrent testing development

### Phase 3: Integration
- Merge implementations
- Cross-UoW integration testing
- Knowledge consolidation
```

**Implementation Protocol:**
```markdown
## Parallel Agent Execution Command (TDD)
Use Claude Code's parallel execution capability with TDD methodology:

"Launch 3 general-purpose agents in parallel to implement UoW-002, UoW-003, and UoW-004 using TDD methodology.
Each agent should follow the complete RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle:

**TDD Phase 1 (RED):**
1. Analyze acceptance criteria for assigned UoW
2. Create comprehensive failing test suite
3. Ensure all tests initially FAIL
4. Validate test coverage planning

**TDD Phase 2 (GREEN):**
1. Implement minimal code to pass each test
2. Follow incremental development approach
3. Ensure all tests consistently pass (GREEN)
4. Avoid premature optimization

**TDD Phase 3 (REFACTOR):**
1. Improve code quality while maintaining GREEN tests
2. Add additional edge case tests
3. Document patterns and knowledge discovered
4. Prepare integration interfaces"
```

### 2. Sequential Agent Collaboration

**For dependent UoWs requiring sequential implementation:**
```markdown
## Sequential Agent TDD Workflow

### Agent 1: TDD Foundation (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- **Task**: Complete TDD cycle for foundational UoW-001
- **TDD Focus**:
  - RED: Create failing tests for core infrastructure
  - GREEN: Implement minimal core services
  - REFACTOR: Optimize foundation for dependent UoWs
- **Output**: Foundation ready for dependent UoWs with tested interfaces

### Agent 2: TDD Dependent Implementation (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- **Task**: Complete TDD cycle for UoW-002 using Agent 1's foundation
- **TDD Focus**:
  - RED: Create failing tests using foundation interfaces
  - GREEN: Implement using validated foundation components
  - REFACTOR: Optimize integration and performance
- **Input**: Agent 1's tested foundation interfaces

### Agent 3: TDD Integration & Quality (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- **Task**: Integration testing and final quality assurance
- **TDD Focus**:
  - RED: Create integration and end-to-end tests
  - GREEN: Implement integration logic
  - REFACTOR: System-wide optimization and documentation
- **Input**: All previous agents' TDD-validated implementations
```

### 3. Specialized Agent Workflows

#### Code Review Agent Pattern
```markdown
## Agent-Based Code Review Process

### Step 1: Implementation Agent
- Implement UoW according to acceptance criteria
- Create initial test suite
- Document basic implementation notes

### Step 2: Review Agent

- Validate test coverage

### Step 3: Documentation Agent
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Update GraphRAG knowledge base
- Generate implementation insights
- Record lessons learned
```

#### Research Agent Pattern
```markdown
## Multi-Agent Research Strategy

### Research Coordination
Launch multiple agents for comprehensive analysis:

**Agent A**: Dependency Analysis
- Analyze all UoW dependencies
- Map interface requirements
- Identify shared components

**Agent B**: Pattern Discovery

- Identify reusable patterns
- Analyze architectural decisions

**Agent C**: Quality Research
- Research testing strategies
- Analyze performance requirements
- Identify security considerations
```

## ðŸ”§ Agent Usage Guidelines

### 1. When to Use Agents vs Direct Tools

#### Use Agents For:
- **Complex Research**: Multi-file analysis requiring several search rounds
- **TDD Implementation**: UoWs with 3+ acceptance criteria requiring full RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- **Cross-Component Work**: Implementation affecting multiple system parts with integration testing
- **Quality Assurance**: TDD-based testing, validation, and continuous integration
- **Knowledge Discovery**: Pattern identification and TDD best practices documentation

#### TDD-Specific Agent Usage:
- **RED Phase Agents**: Complex test creation requiring multiple acceptance criteria analysis
- **GREEN Phase Agents**: Incremental implementation of failing tests
- **REFACTOR Phase Agents**: Code quality improvement while maintaining test integrity
- **Integration Agents**: Cross-UoW testing and system-level validation

#### Use Direct Tools For:
- **Simple File Operations**: Reading/editing specific known files
- **Quick Searches**: Finding specific classes or functions
- **Individual Commands**: Single bash commands or operations

### 2. Agent Coordination Patterns

#### Master-Worker Pattern
```markdown
## Coordination Strategy
### Master Agent (Coordinator)
- Analyzes overall UoW requirements
- Breaks down work into sub-tasks
- Coordinates worker agent execution
- Integrates results and ensures consistency

### Worker Agents (Specialists)
- Focus on specific implementation aspects
- Execute assigned sub-tasks independently
- Report back with implementation and insights
- Maintain consistency with master coordination
```

#### Peer Collaboration Pattern
```markdown
## Equal Collaboration Strategy
### Multiple Expert Agents
- Each agent takes ownership of related UoWs
- Agents coordinate interface requirements
- Shared knowledge base for consistency
- Cross-agent code review and validation
```

### 3. Agent Communication Protocols

#### Information Sharing
```markdown
## Inter-Agent Knowledge Transfer

### Shared Context
- All agents access same SSOT and GraphRAG knowledge
- Consistent project conventions and patterns
- Shared understanding of architecture and goals

### Result Integration
- Standardized documentation formats
- Consistent code style and patterns
