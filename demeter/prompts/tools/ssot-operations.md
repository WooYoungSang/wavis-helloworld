```

### 3. Requirements Gap Analysis
**Operation**: `analyze-requirements-gaps`
**Description**: Identify missing requirements and suggest improvements

**Execution Protocol**:
```markdown
## Gap Analysis Process
### 1. Completeness Assessment
#### Missing Functional Requirements
- Cross-cutting concerns (logging, monitoring, security)
- Error handling and recovery scenarios
- Data validation and integrity checks
- User management and authentication

#### Missing Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance and scalability targets
- Security and compliance standards
- Availability and reliability metrics
- Maintainability and testability requirements

### 2. Quality Enhancement Suggestions
#### Requirement Quality
- Ambiguous requirement descriptions
- Missing acceptance criteria
- Insufficient detail for implementation
- Unclear priority assignments

#### Dependency Analysis
- Missing dependency relationships

- Orphaned UoWs identification
- Critical path optimization opportunities

### 3. Domain-Specific Recommendations
Based on project domain, suggest:
- Industry-standard requirements
- Regulatory compliance needs
- Best practice implementations
- Common feature sets
```

### 4. Contract Verification
**Operation**: `verify-contracts`
**Description**: Validate contract compliance and acceptance criteria

**Execution Protocol**:
```markdown
## Contract Verification Process
### 1. Acceptance Criteria Validation
For each UoW, verify:
- Clear Given-When-Then format
- Testable and measurable criteria
- Complete scenario coverage
- Edge case consideration

### 2. Requirement Traceability
- Ensure all FRs are implemented by UoWs
- Verify NFR satisfaction mapping
- Check acceptance criteria completeness
- Validate test coverage alignment

### 3. Implementation Feasibility
- Assess UoW scope and complexity
- Verify dependency logic
- Check resource requirements
- Evaluate timeline estimates

### 4. Quality Metrics
Generate reports on:
- Contract compliance percentage
- Requirement coverage analysis
- Test case mapping completeness
- Implementation readiness score
```

### 5. SSOT Optimization
**Operation**: `optimize-ssot`
**Description**: Intelligent optimization of SSOT structure and content

**Execution Protocol**:
```markdown
## SSOT Optimization Process
### 1. UoW Decomposition Analysis
- Identify overly large UoWs for splitting
- Detect atomically small UoWs for merging
- Optimize layer distribution
- Balance implementation complexity

### 2. Dependency Optimization
- Minimize dependency chains
- Identify parallel execution opportunities
- Optimize critical path
- Reduce coupling between UoWs

### 3. Priority Rebalancing
- Analyze priority distribution
- Adjust based on business value
- Consider technical dependencies
- Optimize for MVP delivery

### 4. Quality Improvements
- Enhance requirement descriptions
- Improve acceptance criteria clarity
- Add missing cross-references
- Standardize terminology and format
```
