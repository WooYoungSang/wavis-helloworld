# Phase 1-2: AI-Driven SSOT Management and UoW Design

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission
Manage the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) and design Units of Work (UoW) through intelligent analysis and automated generation. Replace all Python script operations with AI-driven processes.

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 1: Requirements Definition and Validation

### 1. SSOT Structure Analysis
**1.1 Read and Validate Current SSOT**
- Load `docs/SSOT.md` and analyze structure
- Check for completeness of FR/NFR/UoW definitions
- Validate YAML syntax and semantic consistency
- Identify gaps or inconsistencies in requirements

**1.2 Requirements Completeness Check**
Ensure each requirement has:
```yaml
functional_requirements:
  FR-XXX:
    name: "Clear, descriptive name"
    description: "Detailed requirement description"
    priority: "High/Medium/Low"
    category: "User-facing/System/Integration"
    stakeholders: ["Business", "Technical", "End-user"]
    acceptance_criteria: "Measurable success criteria"

non_functional_requirements:
  NFR-XXX:
    name: "Performance/Security/Scalability requirement"
    description: "Technical constraint or quality attribute"
    category: "Performance/Security/Usability/Maintainability"
    metrics: "Quantifiable measurements"
    compliance: ["GDPR", "SOC2", "HIPAA"] # if applicable
```

**1.3 Contract Validation**
For each UoW, verify:
- Clear acceptance criteria with Given/When/Then format
- Traceability to FR/NFR requirements
- Testable and measurable success conditions
- Proper dependency mapping

### 2. SSOT Enhancement and Completion
**2.1 Intelligent Gap Filling**
- Identify missing FR/NFR based on domain analysis
- Suggest additional UoWs for complete implementation
- Add cross-cutting concerns (logging, monitoring, security)
- Ensure MVP scope coverage

**2.2 Domain-Specific Requirements**
Based on project domain, add relevant requirements:

**E-Commerce Domain:**
```yaml
FR-ECOM-001:
  name: "Product Catalog Management"
  description: "Manage product listings, inventory, pricing"

NFR-ECOM-001:
  name: "Payment Processing Security"
  description: "PCI-DSS compliant payment handling"
```

**FinTech Domain:**
```yaml
FR-FINTECH-001:
  name: "Financial Transaction Processing"
  description: "Handle financial transactions with audit trail"

NFR-FINTECH-001:
  name: "Regulatory Compliance"
  description: "Meet financial regulations (SOX, GDPR)"
```

**Healthcare Domain:**
```yaml
FR-HEALTH-001:
  name: "Patient Data Management"
  description: "Secure patient information handling"

NFR-HEALTH-001:
  name: "HIPAA Compliance"
  description: "Healthcare data privacy protection"
```

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 2: UoW Design and Dependency Analysis

### 3. UoW Decomposition and Design
**3.1 Intelligent UoW Creation**
Analyze requirements and create optimal UoW breakdown:

```yaml
units_of_work:
  UoW-001:
    name: "Foundation Layer Setup"
    description: "Basic infrastructure and core utilities"
    layer: "Foundation"
    implements: ["FR-001", "FR-002"]
    satisfies: ["NFR-001"]
    dependencies: []
    estimated_effort_hours: 8
    priority: "Critical"

  UoW-002:
    name: "Database Layer Implementation"
    description: "Data access layer with ORM setup"
    layer: "Infrastructure"
    implements: ["FR-003"]
    satisfies: ["NFR-002", "NFR-003"]
    dependencies: ["UoW-001"]
    estimated_effort_hours: 12
    priority: "High"
```

**3.2 Layer-Based Organization**
Organize UoWs by architectural layers:
- **Foundation**: Core utilities, configuration, logging
- **Infrastructure**: Database, external services, messaging
- **Application**: Business logic, domain models
- **Presentation**: APIs, user interfaces
- **Deployment**: Containerization, CI/CD, monitoring

### 4. Dependency Analysis and Optimization
**4.1 Dependency Graph Generation**
Create dependency relationships:
```yaml
dependency_graph:
  UoW-001: []  # No dependencies (foundation)
  UoW-002: ["UoW-001"]  # Depends on foundation
  UoW-003: ["UoW-001", "UoW-002"]  # Depends on both
  UoW-004: ["UoW-002"]  # Parallel with UoW-003
```

**4.2 Parallel Execution Optimization**
Identify UoWs that can run in parallel:
```yaml
execution_phases:
  phase_1:
    name: "Foundation Setup"
    uows: ["UoW-001"]
    parallel: false

  phase_2:
    name: "Infrastructure Layer"
    uows: ["UoW-002", "UoW-003"]  # Can run in parallel
    parallel: true
    max_concurrent: 2

  phase_3:
    name: "Application Layer"
    uows: ["UoW-004", "UoW-005", "UoW-006"]
    parallel: true
    max_concurrent: 3
```

**4.3 Critical Path Analysis**
Identify critical path UoWs that affect overall timeline:
```yaml
critical_path:
  - UoW-001  # Foundation (blocks everything)
  - UoW-002  # Database (blocks application layer)
  - UoW-007  # Core business logic (blocks user features)

estimated_timeline:
  total_hours: 120
  critical_path_hours: 45
  parallel_savings: 30%
```

### 5. Execution Order Generation
**5.1 Create Optimal Execution Sequence**
Generate `batch/configs/uow-execution-order.yaml`:
```yaml
metadata:
  project_name: "[PROJECT_NAME]"
  generated_date: "[CURRENT_DATE]"
  total_uows: 15
  estimated_duration: "120 hours"

execution_phases:
  - phase: 1
    name: "Foundation Layer"
    description: "Core infrastructure setup"
    parallel_groups:
      - uows: ["UoW-001"]
        max_parallel: 1
        estimated_hours: 8

  - phase: 2
    name: "Infrastructure Layer"
    description: "Database and external services"
    parallel_groups:
      - uows: ["UoW-002", "UoW-003"]
        max_parallel: 2
        estimated_hours: 16

uow_metadata:
  UoW-001:
    name: "Foundation Setup"
    layer: "Foundation"
    estimated_hours: 8
    dependencies: []
    criticality: "High"
```

### 6. Enhanced UoW Prompt Generation
**6.1 Create GraphRAG-Integrated Prompts**
For each UoW, generate enhanced prompts in `batch/prompts/`:

```markdown
