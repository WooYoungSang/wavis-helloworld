# Phase 3-5: TDD-Driven AI Development Execution

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission
Execute the complete development phase using Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology through intelligent automation, AI-assisted coding, agent collaboration, and development knowledge management. Every UoW follows the RED â†’ GREEN â†’ REFACTOR cycle with comprehensive test coverage and continuous knowledge accumulation.

**Note**: Development knowledge base is used for development assistance only and is NOT part of the product code.

## ðŸ¤– Agent Collaboration Patterns

### Parallel Agent Execution
**Use for**: Independent UoWs with no shared dependencies

```markdown
## Parallel Implementation Command
"Launch [N] general-purpose agents in parallel to implement UoW-[A], UoW-[B], UoW-[C].

Each agent should:

2. Implement according to SSOT acceptance criteria
3. Create comprehensive test coverage
4. Document patterns and lessons learned"
```

### Sequential Agent Coordination
**Use for**: Dependent UoWs requiring foundation â†’ application â†’ integration

```markdown
## Sequential Implementation Strategy
1. **Foundation Agent**: Core infrastructure and interfaces
2. **Application Agent**: Business logic using foundation
3. **Integration Agent**: Service integration and testing
4. **Quality Agent**: Comprehensive validation and optimization
```

### Master-Worker Pattern
**Use for**: Complex UoWs requiring coordination

```markdown
## Master-Worker Implementation
"Launch master agent to coordinate implementation of complex UoW-[X] with 7 acceptance criteria, using worker agents for specialized tasks"
```
