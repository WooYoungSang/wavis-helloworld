# 🌾 WAVIS Demeter Framework

> **Version 1.3** - AI-First Development Framework with GraphRAG Knowledge Management

A revolutionary AI-First development framework that eliminates script-based operations in favor of intelligent prompt-driven automation. Built for modern software engineering teams who want to maximize productivity while maintaining quality and consistency.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**"Every operation should be a conversation with AI"** - Demeter v1.3 transforms traditional script-heavy development workflows into intuitive, prompt-based interactions that leverage Claude Code's capabilities with comprehensive GraphRAG knowledge management.

### Key Principles
- **Zero Script Dependency**: All operations through AI prompts
- **SSOT-Driven Development**: Single Source of Truth guides everything
- **Knowledge-First Approach**: GraphRAG accumulation drives decisions
- **Contract Engineering**: Acceptance criteria define success
- **AI Collaboration**: Intelligent assistance at every step

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Initialize New Project
Follow the AI-First development lifecycle:

```bash
# Phase 0: Project Initialization
# Execute: demeter/prompts/phase0-project-init.md in Claude Code

# Phase 1-2: SSOT and UoW Design
# Execute: demeter/prompts/phase1-2-ssot-management.md in Claude Code

# Phase 3-5: Development
# Execute: demeter/prompts/phase3-5-development.md in Claude Code

# Phase 6-7: Quality and Deployment
# Execute: demeter/prompts/phase6-7-verification-deployment.md in Claude Code
```

### 2. Use Specialized Tools
Execute specific operations using tool prompts:

```bash
# SSOT Management
# Execute: demeter/prompts/tools/ssot-operations.md

# UoW Management
# Execute: demeter/prompts/tools/uow-management.md

# Agent Collaboration
# Execute: demeter/prompts/tools/agent-collaboration.md
```

## ✨ Major Changes in v1.1

### 🚫 Removed (Zero Script Dependency)
- ❌ All Python scripts (setup.py, merge-ssot.py, etc.)
- ❌ Shell scripts (setup.sh, batch-execute-uows.sh, etc.)
- ❌ Manual configuration files
- ❌ Complex installation procedures

### ✅ Added (AI-First Approach)
- ✅ Phase-based prompt templates

```gherkin
Feature: UoW-001
  As a developer
  I want to implement core functionality
  So that the system meets requirements

  Scenario: Validate basic functionality
    Given the system is properly configured
    When the feature is executed
    Then the expected outcome is achieved
```
