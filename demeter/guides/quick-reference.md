## üìã Core AI Prompts

### Phase-Based Development

| Phase | Prompt | Purpose | Duration |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|
| **Phase 0** | `demeter/prompts/phase0-project-init.md` | Project initialization | 5 min |
| **Phase 1-2** | `demeter/prompts/phase1-2-ssot-management.md` | SSOT & UoW design | 15 min |
| **Phase 3-5** | `demeter/prompts/phase3-5-development.md` | Implementation | 60 min |
| **Phase 6-7** | `demeter/prompts/phase6-7-verification-deployment.md` | Quality & deploy | 15 min |

### Tool-Specific Prompts

| Tool | Prompt | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| **SSOT Operations** | `demeter/prompts/tools/ssot-operations.md` | Requirements management |
| **UoW Management** | `demeter/prompts/tools/uow-management.md` | Task breakdown & tracking |

## ü§ñ Agent Collaboration Commands

### Parallel Agent Execution

```markdown
# For independent UoWs (3+ acceptance criteria each)
"Launch 3 general-purpose agents in parallel to implement UoW-002, UoW-003, UoW-004"

# For different aspects of same feature
"Launch 2 agents in parallel: one for implementation, one for comprehensive testing"

# For complex features
"Launch general-purpose agent to implement UoW-005 which has 7 acceptance criteria"
```

### Sequential Agent Execution

```markdown
# For dependent UoWs
"Launch general-purpose agent to implement UoW-001, then launch another agent to implement UoW-002 which depends on UoW-001"

# For multi-step processes
"First launch agent for database design, then launch agent for API implementation, finally launch agent for integration testing"
```

### Agent Decision Matrix

| UoW Complexity | Acceptance Criteria | Command |
|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Simple** | 1-2 criteria | Direct implementation |
| **Medium** | 3-4 criteria | `"Launch general-purpose agent to implement UoW-XXX"` |
| **Complex** | 5+ criteria | `"Launch general-purpose agent to implement UoW-XXX which has N acceptance criteria"` |
| **Multiple Independent** | 3+ UoWs | `"Launch N agents in parallel to implement UoW-A, UoW-B, UoW-C"` |
| **Dependent Chain** | Sequential UoWs | `"Launch agent for UoW-A, then launch agent for UoW-B which depends on UoW-A"` |

## üê≥ Docker-Compose Commands

### Quick Deployment

```bash
# Single command deployment
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f api

# Scale horizontally
docker-compose up -d --scale api=3

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Development with hot reload
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Production deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# With monitoring stack
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d
```

### Health Checks

```bash
# API health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Docker health status
docker-compose ps

# Service logs
docker-compose logs api
```

## üìä Development Workflow Patterns

### 1. Standard Feature Development

```markdown
# Step 1: Execute Phase 0 (if new project)
Execute: demeter/prompts/phase0-project-init.md

# Step 2: Define requirements
Execute: demeter/prompts/phase1-2-ssot-management.md

# Step 3: Implement with agents
Execute: demeter/prompts/phase3-5-development.md
"Launch 2 agents in parallel to implement UoW-002 and UoW-003"

# Step 4: Verify and deploy
Execute: demeter/prompts/phase6-7-verification-deployment.md
```

### 2. Quick API Development

```markdown
# For simple APIs (like Hello World)
1. Execute: demeter/prompts/phase0-project-init.md
2. Execute: demeter/prompts/phase1-2-ssot-management.md
3. Execute: demeter/prompts/phase3-5-development.md
4. Execute: demeter/prompts/phase6-7-verification-deployment.md

# Result: Complete API with tests and deployment in <2 hours
```

### 3. Complex Feature with Multiple UoWs

```markdown
# For features with 5+ UoWs
Execute: demeter/prompts/phase3-5-development.md
"Launch 3 general-purpose agents in parallel to implement UoW-010, UoW-011, UoW-012"
"Launch agent to implement UoW-013 which depends on UoW-010, UoW-011, UoW-012"

# Benefits: 50% time savings through parallel execution
```

### 4. Bug Fix Workflow

```markdown
# Quality-driven bug fixing
Execute: demeter/prompts/tools/quality-checks.md
"Identify and fix the bug in the authentication system"

# AI will automatically:
# - Analyze the issue
# - Suggest fixes
# - Implement solutions
# - Verify fixes
```

## üö® Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Prompt Not Working

```bash
# 1. Verify prompt file exists
ls demeter/prompts/phase0-project-init.md

# 2. Copy entire content to Claude Code
# 3. Execute as single conversation
# 4. Don't break up the prompt into pieces
```

### Agent Collaboration Issues

```markdown
# Check agent collaboration guide
Execute: demeter/prompts/tools/agent-collaboration.md

# Common fixes:
# - Use "general-purpose" agent type
# - Specify clear UoW boundaries
# - Include acceptance criteria count for complex UoWs
```

### Docker-Compose Problems

```bash
# Common issues:
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d  # Restart services
docker-compose logs api                       # Check logs
docker system prune -f                       # Clean Docker cache

# Port conflicts:
docker-compose down
lsof -i :8000  # Check what's using the port
# Kill conflicting process or change port
```

### Performance Issues

```markdown
Execute: demeter/prompts/tools/quality-checks.md
"Analyze performance bottlenecks and suggest optimizations"

# AI will identify and fix:
# - Slow database queries
# - Inefficient algorithms
# - Memory leaks
# - Network latency issues
```
