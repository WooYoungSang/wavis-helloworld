# Template Usage Instructions
#
# 1. Copy this template to your project: demeter/batch/execution-plans/
# 2. Replace all [PLACEHOLDER] values with project-specific information
# 3. Customize UoWs based on your SSOT analysis
# 4. Adjust TDD configuration for your technology stack
# 5. Execute using: demeter/batch/uow-batch-runner.md
#
# Example Usage:
# "Load execution-plan.yaml and execute TDD-driven batch implementation"
#
# This plan ensures systematic TDD implementation across all UoWs with
# proper dependency management, agent collaboration, and quality gates.
