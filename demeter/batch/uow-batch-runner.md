# ðŸ”„ TDD-Driven UoW Batch Runner - Project Implementation Master

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission
Execute complete project implementation using Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology across all Units of Work (UoWs). Coordinate sequential and parallel execution based on dependency analysis while maintaining the RED â†’ GREEN â†’ REFACTOR cycle for each UoW.

## ðŸ“‹ Execution Overview

### TDD Batch Principles
1. **Test-First Development**: Every UoW starts with failing tests
2. **Dependency Respect**: Execute UoWs in proper dependency order
3. **Parallel Optimization**: Run independent UoWs simultaneously with agents
4. **Quality Gates**: Each UoW must complete full TDD cycle before proceeding
5. **Knowledge Accumulation**: Document patterns and insights throughout execution

## ðŸŽ¯ TDD Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Foundation Level Execution

#### Foundation UoWs (Level 1)
**Command**: `"Execute Level 1 foundation UoWs using TDD methodology"`

```markdown
## Foundation Implementation Strategy

### For Each Foundation UoW:
1. **TDD Cycle Execution**
   - Execute RED phase: Create failing tests from acceptance criteria
   - Execute GREEN phase: Implement minimal code to pass tests
   - Execute REFACTOR phase: Improve code quality while maintaining tests

2. **Quality Verification**
   - Verify all acceptance criteria tested and implemented
   - Ensure code coverage exceeds 80%
   - Validate integration readiness
   - Document patterns and insights

### Example Foundation UoW Execution:
"Execute TDD cycle for UoW-001 (Project Setup):
1. Create failing tests for project structure, configuration, and basic services
2. Implement minimal setup code to pass all tests
3. Refactor for maintainability and documentation
4. Verify foundation readiness for dependent UoWs"
```

#### Foundation Level Completion
```markdown
## Foundation Level Gates
- [ ] All Level 1 UoWs completed TDD cycle
- [ ] Test coverage >80% for foundation components
- [ ] Integration interfaces defined and tested
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] GraphRAG knowledge enhanced
- [ ] Dependent UoWs unblocked
```

### Phase 2: Application Level Execution

#### Parallel UoW Implementation (Level 2+)
**Command**: `"Execute parallel UoW implementation using agent collaboration"`

```markdown

### Parallel Group Execution
For independent UoWs that can run simultaneously:

"Launch [N] general-purpose agents in parallel for TDD implementation:

**Agent A**: Execute complete TDD cycle for UoW-002
- RED: Create comprehensive test suite based on acceptance criteria
- GREEN: Implement minimal code to pass all tests
- REFACTOR: Improve code quality and documentation

**Agent B**: Execute complete TDD cycle for UoW-003
- RED: Create comprehensive test suite based on acceptance criteria
- GREEN: Implement minimal code to pass all tests
- REFACTOR: Improve code quality and documentation

**Agent C**: Execute complete TDD cycle for UoW-004
- RED: Create comprehensive test suite based on acceptance criteria
- GREEN: Implement minimal code to pass all tests
- REFACTOR: Improve code quality and documentation

### Agent Coordination Requirements:
1. Each agent must complete full TDD cycle independently
2. All agents report completion status and test results
3. Integration points must be validated across agents
4. Knowledge sharing between agents for common patterns
5. Collective test coverage validation >80%"
```

#### Sequential Dependencies
**Command**: `"Execute dependent UoWs in sequence following TDD methodology"`

```markdown

   - Confirm all tests GREEN
   - Verify interfaces ready for dependent UoWs
   - Validate integration test readiness

2. **UoW-005 Implementation** (depends on UoW-002)
   - RED: Create tests using UoW-002 interfaces
   - GREEN: Implement using validated UoW-002 components
   - REFACTOR: Optimize integration and performance

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Run cross-UoW integration tests
   - Verify end-to-end workflows
   - Validate acceptance criteria across UoW boundaries"
```

### Phase 3: Integration and Validation

#### Cross-UoW Integration
**Command**: `"Execute comprehensive integration testing and validation"`

```markdown
## Integration TDD Approach

### System-Level Testing
1. **Integration Test Creation**
   - Create tests for UoW interactions
   - Test end-to-end workflows
   - Validate system behavior
   - Test performance requirements

2. **Integration Implementation**
   - Wire UoW components together
   - Implement system-level features
   - Handle cross-cutting concerns
   - Optimize system performance

3. **System Refactoring**
   - Optimize system architecture
   - Improve performance bottlenecks
   - Enhance error handling
   - Complete system documentation
