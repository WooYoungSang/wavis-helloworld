## Constitutional SDD Query Enhancement

### Constitutional Query Types
Extend traditional GraphRAG queries with constitutional intelligence:

1. **Constitutional Compliance Queries**
   ```yaml
   principle_queries:
     library_first_violations:
       query: "Find UoWs that implement custom solutions where libraries exist"
       pattern: "UoW missing constitutional_compliance.library_first.strategy"
       severity: "critical"

     cli_interface_gaps:
       query: "Identify UoWs without proper CLI interface definitions"
       pattern: "UoW missing constitutional_compliance.cli_interface.command"
       severity: "high"

     test_first_compliance:
       query: "Check test-first implementation adherence"
       pattern: "UoW missing test specifications in acceptance criteria"
       severity: "critical"
   ```

2. **Governance-Aware Relationship Discovery**
   ```yaml
   constitutional_relationships:
     principle_implementation:
       source: "UoW with constitutional_compliance"
       target: "Constitutional principle definition"
       relationship: "implements_principle"

       source: "UoW implementation"
       target: "Governance rule requirement"
       relationship: "governed_by"
