## ðŸŽ¯ GitHub SDD /tasks Implementation

This template implements the GitHub SDD `/tasks` command for creating executable task lists from implementation plans.

### Constitutional Task Execution Principles
All tasks must embody the 9 constitutional principles:
1. **Library-First**: Tasks use identified libraries directly
2. **CLI Interface Mandate**: Tasks include CLI implementation and testing
3. **Test-First Imperative**: Testing tasks precede implementation tasks
4. **Simplicity Guidelines**: Tasks follow simplest viable approach
5. **Anti-Abstraction Rules**: Tasks avoid unnecessary abstractions
6. **Integration-First Testing**: Integration testing tasks have priority
7. **Minimal Project Structure**: Tasks maintain flat structure
8. **Framework Direct Usage**: Tasks use frameworks without wrappers
9. **Comprehensive Testing**: Tasks ensure complete test coverage

### Task Execution Instructions

Execute tasks in the following order:
1. **Phase 1**: Execute all TF tasks in parallel
2. **Phase 2**: Execute all LF tasks in parallel (after Phase 1 complete)
3. **Phase 3**: Execute all IN tasks in parallel (after Phase 2 complete)
4. **Phase 4**: Execute CC tasks sequentially (after Phase 3 complete)

Each task should be executed with strict adherence to constitutional principles, with validation at each quality gate.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All tasks map to implementation plan requirements
- [ ] Constitutional principles are embedded in every task
- [ ] Test-first approach is enforced through task sequencing
- [ ] Parallel execution opportunities are identified
- [ ] Quality gates ensure constitutional compliance
- [ ] Specification requirements are fully addressed

Execute this task generation process for the provided implementation plan.
