# 🚀 Advanced Specification-Driven Development (SDD) Workflow

## Overview
This document extends the basic SDD workflow with advanced GitHub Spec-Kit concepts including Project Constitutions, Executable Specifications, Intent-to-Code automation, and AI-driven refinement. This represents the complete implementation of Spec-Kit philosophy within the Demeter WAVIS v1.3 framework.

## Advanced SDD Philosophy

### Beyond Basic SDD: The Spec-Kit Vision
- **Specifications are not documents—they are executable governance systems**
- **Project Constitutions supersede all other development practices**
- **AI continuously refines specifications for optimal quality**
- **Intent-to-code automation eliminates boilerplate development**
- **Constitutional compliance is automated and continuously monitored**

## Advanced SDD Workflow Components

### 1. Project Constitution Establishment
Before any development begins, establish the project's constitutional governance system.

- `{{EXTENSIONS}}`: Domain extensions (e-commerce, fintech, healthcare, iot)
- `{{PROJECT_DOMAIN}}`: Specific domain context
- `{{TEAM_SIZE}}`: Team size for governance scaling

**Constitutional Elements Generated:**
1. **Core Constitutional Principles**: 9 base SDD principles with project-specific enforcement
