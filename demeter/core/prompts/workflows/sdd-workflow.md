# üìã GitHub Specification-Driven Development (SDD) Workflow

## Overview
This workflow implements the GitHub SDD methodology within the Demeter WAVIS v1.3 framework, providing a complete `/specify` ‚Üí `/plan` ‚Üí `/tasks` workflow for specification-driven development.

## SDD Constitutional Principles

### The 9 Constitutional Principles
1. **Library-First**: Prefer existing libraries over custom implementations
2. **CLI Interface Mandate**: All features must be accessible via CLI
3. **Test-First Imperative**: Write tests before implementation
4. **Simplicity Guidelines**: Choose simple solutions over complex ones
5. **Anti-Abstraction Rules**: Avoid premature abstraction
6. **Integration-First Testing**: Focus on integration over unit tests
7. **Minimal Project Structure**: Keep structure simple and flat
8. **Framework Direct Usage**: Use frameworks directly, not through abstractions
9. **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensure complete test coverage

## SDD Workflow Steps

### Step 1: `/specify` - Create Precise Specifications

#### 1.1 Execute SDD Specification Prompt
```bash
# Use SDD specification template
# Template: demeter/core/prompts/templates/sdd-specification.prompt.template
```

**Input Variables:**
- `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`: Your project name
- `{{EXTENSIONS}}`: Domain extensions (e-commerce, fintech, etc.)
- `{{FEATURE_NAME}}`: Feature being specified
- `{{FEATURE_DESCRIPTION}}`: High-level feature description

**Process:**
1. **Constitutional Analysis**: Analyze feature against 9 constitutional principles
2. **User Story Development**: Transform description into structured user stories
3. **Acceptance Criteria Definition**: Create testable, measurable criteria
4. **CLI Interface Specification**: Define complete CLI access
5. **Ambiguity Detection**: Mark unclear items with [CLARIFY] markers
6. **Technical Requirements**: Specify libraries, dependencies, and interfaces

**Output:** Complete, unambiguous specification with:
- Structured user stories with acceptance criteria
- Constitutional compliance approach
- CLI interface definition
- Technical requirements and dependencies
- Quality gates and validation criteria
- [CLARIFY] items requiring further definition

#### 1.2 Specification Validation
Validate the specification against these criteria:
- [ ] Every user story has testable acceptance criteria
- [ ] All constitutional principles are addressed
- [ ] CLI interface is completely defined
- [ ] Dependencies and libraries are identified
- [ ] Ambiguities are marked with [CLARIFY]
- [ ] Quality metrics are measurable

### Step 2: `/plan` - Generate Implementation Plan

#### 2.1 Execute SDD Planning Prompt
```bash
# Use SDD plan template
# Template: demeter/core/prompts/templates/sdd-plan.prompt.template
```

**Input Variables:**
- `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`: Your project name
- `{{EXTENSIONS}}`: Domain extensions
- `{{SPECIFICATION_FILE}}`: Path to completed specification
- `{{FRAMEWORK_PATH}}`: Demeter framework path

**Process:**
1. **Constitutional Architecture Design**: Apply constitutional principles to architecture
2. **Technical Implementation Plan**: Create detailed technical approach
3. **Quality Assurance Plan**: Define validation and testing approach
4. **Risk Assessment**: Identify risks and constitutional mitigations
5. **Implementation Timeline**: Estimate effort with constitutional approach

**Output:** Detailed implementation plan with:
- Constitutional architecture design
- Technical implementation layers
- Quality assurance strategy
- Risk mitigation plans
- Implementation timeline and effort estimates

#### 2.2 Plan Validation
Validate the implementation plan:
- [ ] Every specification requirement has implementation approach
- [ ] All 9 constitutional principles are applied
- [ ] CLI interface implementation is detailed
- [ ] Library selections are justified
- [ ] Integration strategy prioritizes integration testing
- [ ] Quality gates are specific and measurable

### Step 3: `/tasks` - Create Executable Task List

#### 3.1 Execute SDD Task Generation Prompt
```bash
# Use SDD tasks template
# Template: demeter/core/prompts/templates/sdd-tasks.prompt.template
```

**Input Variables:**
- `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`: Your project name
- `{{EXTENSIONS}}`: Domain extensions
- `{{IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_FILE}}`: Path to implementation plan
- `{{SPECIFICATION_FILE}}`: Path to specification

**Process:**
1. **Test-First Task Creation**: Create test creation tasks with priority
2. **Library-First Implementation Tasks**: Create implementation tasks using libraries
3. **Integration-First Validation Tasks**: Create integration testing tasks
4. **Constitutional Compliance Tasks**: Create compliance validation tasks
5. **Parallel Execution Planning**: Identify [PARALLEL] execution opportunities

**Output:** Complete executable task list with:
- Test-first task sequencing
- Constitutional principle compliance in every task
- Parallel execution markers for efficiency
- Quality gates and checkpoints
- Effort estimates and critical path

#### 3.2 Task List Validation
Validate the task list:
- [ ] Tasks follow constitutional principles
- [ ] Test-first approach is enforced
- [ ] Parallel execution opportunities identified
- [ ] Quality gates ensure compliance
- [ ] All specification requirements addressed

## Integration with Demeter WAVIS

### SDD-Enhanced SSOT Generation
The SDD workflow integrates with Demeter's SSOT system:

```bash
# 1. Initialize project with SDD enhancement
./demeter-init.sh my-project "e-commerce"

# 2. Execute SDD workflow for requirements
# Use SDD templates in .demeter/prompts/

# 3. Generate SDD-compliant SSOT
# Enhanced templates include constitutional compliance

# 4. Execute TDD with SDD principles
./demeter-uow-executor.sh
```

### SDD Template Integration
All Demeter prompt templates now include SDD enhancements:
- **ssot-generation.prompt.template**: Constitutional SSOT structure
- **requirements-analysis.prompt.template**: SDD-based analysis
- **tdd-executor.prompt.template**: Specification-driven TDD
- **sdd-specification.prompt.template**: Pure SDD `/specify` implementation
- **sdd-plan.prompt.template**: Pure SDD `/plan` implementation
- **sdd-tasks.prompt.template**: Pure SDD `/tasks` implementation

## SDD Workflow Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce Feature Development
```

Step 1: /specify
- Input: High-level cart feature description
- Output: Detailed specification with user stories, CLI interface, constitutional compliance

Step 2: /plan
- Input: Cart specification

- **After `/plan`**: Validate constitutional implementation approach
- **After `/tasks`**: Confirm constitutional task execution
- **During execution**: Continuous constitutional compliance validation

### SDD Quality Gates
1. **Specification Quality**: Clear, testable, constitutionally compliant
2. **Plan Quality**: Detailed, constitutional, risk-mitigated
3. **Task Quality**: Executable, constitutional, parallel-optimized
4. **Implementation Quality**: Constitutional compliance throughout
