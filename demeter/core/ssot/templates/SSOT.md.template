## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Sequence
1. **Prerequisites First**: Complete UoW-000 through UoW-001D before any implementation
2. **Layer by Layer**: Complete each layer (Foundation → Infrastructure → Business) before proceeding
3. **Dependency Respect**: Never implement a UoW before its dependencies are complete
4. **Testing Priority**: Write tests first (TDD approach) for all UoWs
5. **Documentation**: Update documentation and capture learnings with each UoW

### Quality Gates
- **Foundation UoWs**: 80%+ test coverage, architectural review required
- **Infrastructure UoWs**: Integration testing, security review required
- **Business UoWs**: 60%+ test coverage, business logic validation required
- **Deployment UoWs**: End-to-end testing, security scanning required

### Agent Collaboration
- **Planning**: Use `task-decomposition-expert` for complex UoWs
- **Architecture**: Use `system-architect` for design decisions
- **Implementation**: Use technology-specific experts based on chosen stack
- **Testing**: Use `test-engineer` for comprehensive test strategies
- **Review**: Use `code-reviewer` and `architect-reviewer` for quality validation

### Knowledge Management
- **GraphRAG Integration**: Query for context before each UoW implementation
- **Pattern Documentation**: Capture reusable patterns in LEARNING.md
- **Decision Records**: Document architectural decisions in ADRs
- **Cross-Reference Updates**: Maintain FR/NFR/UoW mappings throughout development
